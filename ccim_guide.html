	<p>This is the guide for 
		<a href="index.html" target="_blank">Character Collection for Injustice Mobile</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What You Can Do with the  Character Collection Spreadsheet</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Track your Character Collection, saving it to a file, the server, or both</li>
		<li><a href="#AskTeamBuilding">Ask others for help with building your team, and help others with building their teams</a></li>
		<li><a href="#GetMaxedChars">Get a list of all characters at any Elite and XP levels, with 0%, 50%, or 100% augmentations</a></li>
		<li>Erase the form and start over</li>
		<li>Sort and Filter the characters in your collection.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The following sections will describe how to do each of these things</p>
	
	<h2>Tracking Your Own Character Collection</h2>
	
	<p>How to enter Elite and XP for your character collection:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the "Tag:" field, type a name which will be easy for you to remember</li>
		
		<li>Fix the bonuses to match what you have in your collection:<ol>
			<li>Click "Edit > Change Support Cards".</li>
			<li>In the popup, uncheck any support bonus cards you do not have.</li>
			<li>Check the ones you do have in your collection.</li>
			<li>When you are done, click "Apply"</li> </ol>
			</li>
		
		<li>Change which columns are displayed on the form. To do this: 
			<ol><li>Click "Preferences > Configure Columns".</li><li>
			Remove all columns except for Elite and XP. If Elite and XP are not there, add them.</li>
			<li>Click "Apply Changes".</li></ol>
			By eliminating extraneous columns, it is easier to enter data. </li>
			
		<li>If your device is fast enough &amp; your screen is tall enough, then
			you can increase the number of characters per page using 
			"Preferences > Change #Characters per Page". </li>
			
		<li>Open the Injustice app on your device</li>

		<li>Sort the characters in the app by Name. Also sort the form by "Name"</li>

		<li>On the form, use the tab key (or mouse-click) to get to the Elite and XP fields of each Character you have, then
			enter the Elite and XP values of your cards.</li>
		
		<li>When you finish with the last character on the form, click on the "> 1" button to go forward to the next page of characters.</li>
		
		<li>Continue entering Elite and XP values for your Character Cards until you finish the last page.</li>
	</ol>
		
	<p>Finally, <strong>SAVE YOUR WORK!</strong> Click on "File > Server: Save" (or "File > File: Save").
		When you come back to the form, you will be able to use
		"File > Server: Load" (or "File > File: Load") to get your work back.</p>
	
	<hr>
	<p>Here are the rest of the fields you can enter for each character, and where they appear in the Injustice app:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Damage</dt><dd>Appears under the blue fist on the back of the card</dd>
		<dt>Health</dt><dd>Appears under the red heart</dd>
		
		<dt>Special 1 Bars</dt><dd>Appears along the bottom of the character card</dd>
		<dt>Special 2 Bars</dt><dd>Appears along the bottom of the character card, after Special 1 bars</dd>
		<dt>Super Bars</dt><dd>Appears along the bottom of the character card, after Special 2 bars</dd>
		
		<dt>Crit. Chance</dt><dd>Appears on the next line under "Damage" and "Health"</dd>
		<dt>Crit. Damage</dt><dd>Appears on the next line under "Damage" and "Health", after Crit Chance</dd>
		
		<dt>Gear Slots</dt><dd>Appears on the right side of the card, under the character's support cards. Enter a number 1 to 3</dd>
		<dt>In Store</dt><dd>Tap "Store" to go to the store in the app. Tap the "Add Characters" and "Promote" tabs to see which cards are available in the store</dd>
		<dt>Extra Cards</dt><dd>Tap "Store" to go to the store. Tap "Sell" tab to see which cards you have extra copies of.</dd>
	</dl>
 
	<p>To enter these values into the form:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Sort the form the same way you sort the characters in the app</li>
		<li>Click "Preferences > Configure Columns" to display the columns you would like to edit</li>
		<li>In the app, tap the character card to see the back of it.</li>
		<li>On the form, click the field to be changed, and type in the value (usually a number). If you have a keyboard, the tab key may be helpful.</li>
		<li>Once again, do not forget to <strong>save your changes</strong> using "File > Server: Save" (or "File > File: Save")</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note that if you have already set the Elite and XP values for a character,
		the Damage and Health fields will already have values in them. 
		If the Damage and/or Health values on the form do not match those on your cards in the app,
		you have probably applied Damage or Health augmentation cards in the app.
		When you change the fields on the form to match the values in the app, 
		the Damage Augmentation Level and/or the
		Health Augmentation Level will be automatically recalculated.</p>
	
	<p>Other columns for each character: some columns are constants
		(such as Cost) or are calculated (such as Augmentation Level). Here's a list of them:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Cost</dt><dd>Constant: Number of power credits needed to buy the character, if it is in the store, except for The Killing Joke Joker.</dd>
		<dt>Base Damage</dt><dd>Constant: Starting Damage Stat when the character is first added to your collection at Elite 0, XP level 1</dd>
		<dt>Base Health</dt><dd>Constant: Starting Health Stat when the character is at Elite 0, XP level 1</dd>
		
		<dt>Resale</dt><dd>Calculated: 0.3 X Cost</dd>
		<dt>Special 1 Min</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage and Number of Special 1 bars</dd>
		<dt>Special 1 Max</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage and Number of Special 1 bars</dd>
		<dt>Special 2 Min</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage and Number of Special 2 bars</dd>
		<dt>Special 2 Max</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage and Number of Special 2 bars</dd>
		<dt>Super</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage and Number of Super bars</dd>
		<dt>Damage Augmentation Level</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Damage, Elite, and XP</dd>
		<dt>Health Augmentation Level</dt><dd>Calculated, based on Health, Elite, and XP</dd>
		<dt>Base Damage + Base Health</dt><dd>Calculated, the sume of Base Damage and Base Health</dd>
		<dt>Damage + Health</dt><dd>Calculated, the sume of Damage and Health</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id='GetMaxedChars'>Get a list of all characters at any Elite and XP levels</h2>
	<p>Let's suppose you want to see a list of all characters' Damage and Health at Elite 7, XP level 50, with maxed augmentations. Here's how you do it.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>If you were working on your own collection, <strong>save it</strong> to the server or a file</li>
		<li>Click "Select > Select All"</li>
		<li>Click "Edit > Change to maximum values ..."<li>
		<li>Select 100%</li>
		<li>If Damage or Health columns are not visible, click "Preferences > Configure Columns" and add them</li>
		<li>If you like, you can sort by Damage or Health</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You can calculate 0% or 50% augmentation levels the same way.</p>
	
	<p>You can calculate any other XP or Elite level using "Edit > Change Selected Characters"</p>

	<p>There are other fields you can enter for each character. You can find the fields by 
		adding their columns with "Preferences > Configure Columns". Some of the columns are 
		'calculated' fields (like Augmentation Level) or 'constant' fields 
		(like Cost) which cannot be altered.</p>

	<p><strong>Second method</strong>, possibly faster once you get the hang of it:</p>
