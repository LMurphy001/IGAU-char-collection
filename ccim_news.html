	<p>This is news for 
		<a href="index.html" target="_blank">Character Collection for Injustice Mobile</a>.
	</p>
	
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Initial open of form: bottom scrollbar is still too wide</li>
		<li>Customizing columns and their order: when form first comes up, the list at the bottom is sometimes in the wrong order from what is currently in the actual table</li>
		<li>When a new character card is added to characters.js, old saved collections become invalid. 
			Need to add code to merge blank records, after the saved chars data is loaded, for these new character cards.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Done</h2>
	Most recently done is on top.
	<ol>
		<li>12/18/2016: Added additional automatically calculated field "Elite Plus Extra Cards" - displaying, sorting, filtering. Hopefully it will help with the 'Breakthrough' feature (promoting cards beyond e7 50).</li>
		<li>12/18/2016: Added elite filter levels for 8, 9 and 10</li>
		<li>12/18/2016: When first opening the page, the previous page only showed three columns: Select, Elite, XP. This version shows Select, Elite, Xp, Damage, Health, Extra Cards, Elite Plus Extra Cards</li>
		<li>12/18/2016: Fixed code which Restores a saved collection. (Checkbox for color, Tag name, sorted by drop-down box</li>
		<li>12/18/2016: Made 'Tag' a required field when saving to the server.</li>
		<li>Test 'Load from server collections'. Medium effort.</li>
		<li>Implement 'Save to Server'. Medium effort.</li>
		<li>Added 'Cost' filter</li>
		<li>Added 'Resale' column</li>
		<li>Fixed elite and xp validation when 'onchange' event fires</li>
		<li>Write Validate()</li>
		<li>Changed generic 'showMessage' to use a dynamic Popup, if available</li>
		<li>Updated guide page</li>
		<li>Fixed: Bottom scrollbar of character table extends too far on the right.</li>
		<li>Implement 'Edit Bonuses'.</li>
		<li>Updated 'Filters' and tested. Seems to be working now.</li>
		<li>Pin Name,Title,Select columns on the left; make all other columns scroll horz on the right.</li>
		<li>Update To Do list in the Guide</li>
		<li>Give user the ability to configure the list of columns and the order in which they're displayed</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Coding 'To Do'</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Write Form so players can report problems, ask questions, or make suggestions to the tools</li>
		
		<li>Make a list of all functionality. Include it in the guide. Medium effort.</li>
		
		<li>Test all functionality, debug, test changes. Large effort.</li>
		
		<li>Refactor code, make improvements in readability, maintainability, modularity, scalability, performance.
		
		<li>Rewrite javascript as jquery? Fast enough?</li>
		
		<li>Combine and minify all javascript before deploying. Improve deployment procedure if possible.</li>

		<li>Add statistics/analysis. Medium effort.</li>
		
		<li>Implement 'Make Donation'. Effort unknown.</li>
		
		<li>Find a way for users to 'login' and 'logout'. HTTPS needed? Use OpenId? Cost in USD? Effort?</li>

		<li>Long term: Add a "Gears" collection spreadsheet. Need all relevant gear properties.  Very Large Effort</li>

		<li>Long term: Add a way to gather teams of 3 characters plus up to 3 gear per character from the spreadsheets. 
			Ability to name the team. Add the last modification timestamp automatically, and 
			save it all somewhere (file, server). A collection of teams, in a spreadsheet. 
			Major enhancement. Very Large Effort.</li>		
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Documentation 'To Do'</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Write the Guide</li>
	</ol>
	<!--
		<li>Fix blog. Maybe uninstalling and re-installing it is faster, easier? Large effort.</li>
		
		<li>Update the guide page. Include the purpose of the tool, a list of all functionality,
		'how-tos', reproducible issues, reported issues, to do list, suggestion list with polls to get user votes... Large effort.</li>
		
		<li>Write a blog page for the Character Collection tool. Link to both the tool and the guide. 
			Ask people to comment, make suggestions, report problems, ask questions, etc. Large effort</li>
		
		<li>From the tool page and the guide page, include link to the blog page for Character Collection tool. Small effort.</li>
		
		<li>Possibly turn the 'Guide' into a blog page? Or combine the two blog pages? 
		Will need to decide how the content I write makes most sense spread out over blog pages. 
		Guide probably needs to be a static page. 
		On-going items such as "News", "To-Do", "Done", "Reported Issues", "Reproducible Issues", 
		"Suggestions", "Polls", "Questions" are more dynamic. 
		How? Does each suggestion become its own page? Does the list of suggestions become a page which I edit?</li>
